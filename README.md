# Paperoid

Paperoid is an AI-powered PDF reader in the very early stages of development. The project aims to create a web-based PDF viewer with AI capabilities to enhance document interaction and analysis.

**Note: This project is currently in its initial development phase and consists only of basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.**

## Current Status

Paperoid is at the prototype stage. The current implementation includes:

- Basic HTML structure
- CSS styling for layout and design
- Initial JavaScript functionality

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main page structure
- `styles.css`: CSS styles for the application
- `script.js`: JavaScript file for basic functionality

## Planned Features

- PDF rendering using react-pdf
- AI-powered document analysis and insights
- User-friendly interface for navigation and annotation
- Integration with MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) in future development phases

## Setup

As the project is in its early stages, you can simply clone the repository and open the HTML file in a web browser to view the current prototype.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/paperoid.git
